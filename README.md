This is a small game written in Python using the pygame package.  
Because I am a crazy young person, some of this code was even written by ChatGPT, because why the hell not. 

## I want to play
Sure you do! 
Just install the requirements using `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` and start the game with `python main.py`

## But what are the rules?
The goal is to get as many points as possible by combining three or more squares in a row by swapping them around. 

If you get a combination longer than three blocks, you get bonus points. 

If you make a chain reaction happen, you also get bonus points. 

## But why? 
I was bored during some of my lectures and started coding, also I thought KDiamond (the KDE Linux version of 
some candy themed game that is also similar to this one) was bad and wanted to make something better. 

This project also shows how simple it is to make a little game using pygame!
